# Insights_and_prediction_of_Suicidal_incidence-
This repository is based on a data set of  WHO of 1979 to 2016. Some of insights May help to understand the scenario and mental health of all over the world 

## Data :
WHO Suicide Statistics
Basic historical (1979-2016) data by country, year and demographic groups

## About Data: 
This Data set includes Suicidal data of 1979 to 2016 of various country & their population , various age, gender & number of suicide.

## My Perception : 
There can be many reason behind Suicide. But Mostly I can feel it as an expression of poor mental health. Due to running pandemic many people are writing about mental health, So I thought to explore about past suicidal rate.
I presented here, some of relations between year, age,gender and so on... I had an idea to fit a model to predict the upcoming scenario.

## What I did
- Observe the Data set
- Handle the missing Field
- Explore Insight

## Insights Explored :
- Year vs number of suicidal incidence based on gender
- Suicidal incidence based on age & correlation with gender
- Correlation between year & age
- Correlation between country & number of suicidal incidence
- Visualization of the linear relationship of total suicidal incidence per year all over the world


## Future work to do :
- Design a model
- Predict about the upcoming scenario
